Sapwood doesn't judge. It's not that it's aloof. It cares about you very much.
It wants to be the content mechanism behind your next great idea. But it lets
you design your own content structure, and it wants you to use the tools you
already love to surface your content in any way you can dream it.

All relevant documentation on Sapwood currently resides on our website,
[sapwood.org](http://sapwood.org). It's possible some documentation is lagging
behind and you may find some additional details in the issues here.

Thank you for your interest in Sapwood. I hope you enjoy. And absolutely
provide feedback of your experience!
